# Customer Product Prediction

A Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the most likely product category a customer will purchase based on demographic and behavioral data.  
The system uses a trained ML model and is deployed using Flask with an interactive web interface.

---

## Project Overview

Customer Product Prediction is a **supervised machine learning classification project** designed to assist businesses in understanding customer behavior and improving product recommendations.

This project was developed as a **Final-Year Engineering Project** and demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Model serialization
- Web deployment using Flask

---

## Problem Statement

To predict the **next product category** a customer is likely to purchase using historical customer data such as age, income, spending behavior, browsing time, and past purchases.

---

## Machine Learning Approach

- **Type:** Multi-class Classification  
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Why Random Forest?**
  - Handles non-linear data well
  - Reduces overfitting
  - Provides high accuracy for tabular datasets

---

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  
- **Web Framework:** Flask  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Model Serialization:** Pickle

🖥 Application Features

    User-friendly web interface

    Real-time customer product prediction

    Dropdown-based inputs (no manual encoding)

    Human-readable prediction output

    Scalable ML deployment architecture

 Dataset Description

The dataset is synthetically generated and includes:

    Customer demographics (age, gender, income)

    Behavioral metrics (spending score, browsing time)

    Purchase history

    Target product category

This ensures privacy while maintaining realistic patterns for learning.
 Results & Insights

    Spending score and past purchases are strong predictors

    Random Forest provides reliable performance on customer data

    Model can be extended for real-world recommendation systems

 Future Enhancements

    Add confidence/probability scores

    Integrate XGBoost or Neural Networks

    Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS / Render)

    Connect with real-time databases

    Add user authentication
